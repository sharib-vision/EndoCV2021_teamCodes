# EndoCV2021 teamCodes 
### For the 3rd International Endoscopy Computer Vision Challenge and Workshop (EndoCV2021)

**About:**
The codes for some teams are shared here for reproducibility purposes as part of EndoCV2021 challenge, and upon consent with the participating teams under EndoCV2021.

**Challenge title:** Addressing generalisability in polyp detection and segmentation

**Short description:**
Computer-aided detection, localization, and segmentation methods can help improve colonoscopy procedures. Even though many methods have been built to tackle automatic detection and segmentation of polyps, benchmarking and development of computer vision methods remains an open problem. This is mostly due to the lack of datasets or challenges that incorporate highly heterogeneous dataset appealing participants to test for generalisation abilities of the methods. we aim to build a comprehensive, well-curated, and defined dataset from 6 different centres worldwide and provide 5 datasets types that include: i) multi-centre train-test split from 5 centres ii) polyp size-based split (participants should do this by themselves if of interest), iii) data centre wise split, iv) modality split (only test) and v) one hidden centre test. Participants will be evaluated on all types to address strength and weaknesses of each participantsâ€™ method.  Both detection bounding boxes and pixel-wise segmentation of polyps will be provided.
